This project consists of a multi-sheet Excel dashboard designed to analyze the global job market 
data using formula-based calculations, KPIs, and interactive charts.

###  Job Title Analysis

- Allows comparison of demand across different data-related roles.
- Selection of a job title dynamically updates related KPIs and charts.

###  Salary Insights
- Built a **KPI card** to display the **average salary** for the selected job title.
- Salary values are calculated using Excel formulas based on filtered data.
- Helps identify high-paying roles in the job market.

###  Country-wise Job Distribution
- Designed a **map chart** to visualize which **countries have the highest number of job postings**.
- The map updates based on the selected job title.
- Enables geographic comparison of job demand across regions.

###  Platform-wise Job Posting Analysis
